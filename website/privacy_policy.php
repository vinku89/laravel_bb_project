                  BestBox respects your privacy. This Privacy Statement explains what information we collect through our
                  websites (the “Sites”), through our products and when you contact us for support, how we use that
                  information, and what choices you have.
               </p>
               <p>The Sites may contain links to other web sites. This Privacy Statement does not apply to the practices
                  of any company or individual that BestBox does not control, or any web sites that you link to from the
                  Sites. You should carefully review the privacy policies of any web sites that you visit from ours to
                  learn more about their information and privacy practices. The collection and use of your personal
                  information shall be governed by such other party or site’s privacy policy. BestBox is not responsible
                  for their privacy practices.</p>
               <p>Please take a few moments to read this Privacy Statement. By accessing the Sites or using a BestBox
                  product, you agree to accept the terms and conditions of this Privacy Statement and are aware that our
                  policies may change in the future.</p>

               What information we collect
            </h2>
            <div class="bb_page_content_text f16 text-color-primary">
               <p>In various places on the Sites and through the BestBox products, we collect “Personally Identifiable
                  Information” such as your name, mailing address, telephone number, email address, or other information
                  that can be used to identify you or contact you. For example, we collect this information when you
                  create an account, register for our message boards, sign up for our email newsletter, and purchase
                  from our website or register a BestBox product, download a software update, enter a sweepstakes or
                  participate in surveys, promotions and give-away. From time to time in the future we may offer
                  software updates, upgrades, additional features, services and promotional opportunities that would
                  require you to submit Personally Identifiable Information to participate.</p>
               <p>We also collect “Anonymous Information” such as your IP address, the type of browser you use, the
                  pages on our Sites that you visit, the search terms that you enter or the advertisements that you
                  click. Anonymous information can and will NOT be associated with Personally Identifiable Information.
               </p>
               <p>Like many Internet sites, we also use “cookies” to collect information. A cookie is a small data file
                  that we transfer to your computer and is stored on your hard drive. When you visit our Sites the
                  cookie identifies your computer to us so that you do not have to re-register each time you visit. We
                  also use cookies to measure the traffic to and usage of our site and its different services and
                  features, and other miscellaneous uses.
               </p>
               <p>BestBox products upload usage information to BestBox as part of their normal functioning. The
                  collected information includes the specific identifiers of streams played, duration played, various
                  quality measures, error logs, software version numbers, and other usage statistics. Usage information
                  uploaded from BestBox products is personally identifiable by product serial number. In some cases,
                  serial numbers are associated with personally identifiable information for customer service and
                  support.
               </p>
               <p>The information collected from many users is aggregated for analysis and, in some instances, made
                  generally available anonymously to users of BestBox products and BestBox services. For example,
                  BestBox may use such information to provide features such as lists of popular videos. BestBox may also
                  use personally identifiable information to make content recommendations to individual users.</p>
               <p>If you do not wish BestBox to use your information as described in this section, please follow the
                  procedure in “What Choices You Have” below.
               </p>
               <p>We do not intend that children will use the Sites. We do not solicit or knowingly collect information
                  from children under 18 years of age, nor will we accept registration from them.

            <div class="bb_page_content_text f16 text-color-primary">
               <p>We use Personally Identifiable Information that you provided us to perform the services for which the
                  data was collected, such as for order fulfillment, customer support and marketing activities, such as
                  e-mail newsletters and sending you information about products and services that may be of interest to
                  you. Later on in this Privacy Statement, we provide you with more information on how to opt-out of
                  marketing communications.</p>
               <p>We use non-Personally Identifiable Information to determine how people use the Sites and its services
                  and to analyze usage and performance of our products and their software and features. For example this
                  data tells us information including how often users click on our advertisements, which files are
                  downloaded most frequently, and which areas of our site are the most popular. Analyzing this data
                  allows us to improve our products and services.

               How we share information
            </h2>
            <div class="bb_page_content_text f16 text-color-primary">
               <p>We sometimes use third parties to help with certain aspects of our operations, such as processing
                  credit card payments and providing marketing assistance. When we supply Personally Identifiable
                  Information to these third parties, we require them to use it only for the function they are
                  contracted to perform.
               </p>
               <p>We will disclose Personally Identifiable Information as required by law, or if in our judgment it is
                  necessary to protect BestBox or our users from loss or liability. We may share some or all of your
                  personal information with our current or future “affiliates” (which means a parent company, any
                  subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under a common control), in which case we will
                  require our affiliates to honor this privacy policy. If we merge with or are acquired by another
                  company, the resulting combined company will use the information you have provided as described in
                  this policy. If we cease operation, your information may be transferred to and used by another company
                  that offers similar or related products or services. While we cannot predict about such an unlikely
                  event, we would hope this could provide you continuity of service.
