                        Method each month on the calendar day corresponding
                        to the commencement of your paying membership.<br><br>

                     <li>
                        We reserve the right to change the timing of our billing, in particular, as indicated below,
                        if your Payment Method has not
                        successfully settled. In the event your paying membership began on a day not contained in a
                        given month, we may bill your Payment
                        Method on a day in the applicable month or such other day as we deem appropriate. For
                        example, if you started your BestBox
                        membership or became a paying member on January 31st, your next payment date is likely to be
                        February 28th, and your Payment
                        Method would be billed on that date. Your renewal date may change due to changes in your
                        Membership. Visit our sign in
                        page and sign in to your account to see the commencement date for your next renewal period.
                        We may authorize your Payment Method

                  action. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement and the termination
                  of your BestBox membership.
               </li>

               <li>If you elect to seek arbitration or file a small claim court action, you must first send to
                  BestBox, by certified mail, a written Notice of your claim (“Notice”). The Notice to BestBox must
                  be addressed to: General Counsel, BestBox, Monte International Trade (Tianjin) Co Ltd, 5009-22,
                  Block B, Dongjiang Financial Trade Services Center, Dongjian Bonded Port Area, Tianjian Free Trade
                  Zone, China (“Notice Address”). If BestBox initiates arbitration, it will send a written Notice to
                  the email address used for your membership account. A Notice, whether sent by you or by BestBox,
                  must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific
                  relief sought (“Demand”). If BestBox and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within
                  60 (sixty) days after the Notice is received, you or BestBox may commence an arbitration proceeding
                  or file a claim in small claims court. </li>
               <li>The arbitration will be governed by the then current rules of CIETAC, and the arbitration
                  proceedings shall be conducted in English language and shall take place in Shanghai. The
                  arbitration award shall be final and binding upon both Parties.</li>
               <li>YOU AND BESTBOX AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL
                  CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE
                  PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and BestBox agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not
                  consolidate more than one person’s claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any
                  form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be
                  unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void. The
                  arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking
                  relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual
                  claim.</li>
